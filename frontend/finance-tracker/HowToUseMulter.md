Do the front end and back end create the same URL or two different URLs when an image is right-clicked and opened in a new tab?

✅ They create the same final URL that points to the uploaded image, as long as:
The uploads folder is publicly served in your backend (like using express.static()).

The backend constructs and sends back the correct imageUrl.

The frontend uses that imageUrl to display or reference the image.

🔁 How this works in the flow:
📤 Frontend:
You send an image using FormData with key "image" via:

formData.append('image', imageFile);
You await the backend response:

return response.data; // contains { imageUrl: "http://localhost:5000/uploads/1715199999999-cat.png" }

📥 Backend:
Saves the image using multer, typically in a folder like uploads/.

Then constructs the image URL:

const imageUrl = `${req.protocol}://${req.get("host")}/uploads/${req.file.filename}`;
And sends this imageUrl back to the frontend.

🌐 Browser:
Frontend displays the image using the imageUrl it got from the backend.

So, when a user right-clicks and opens the image in a new tab, the browser loads the image from that same URL.

✅ To Make This Work:
Make sure in your backend you're serving the uploads folder like this:

app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));
This tells Express: "Whenever a request comes to /uploads/..., serve the files from the uploads directory."

🔍 Example Final Image URL:
If you're running the server locally:

http://localhost:5000/uploads/1715199999999-cat.png
If you're deployed:

https://yourdomain.com/uploads/1715199999999-cat.png
This will be the same URL shown:

In the network tab

In <img src=...>

When you right-click → Open image in new tab

Let me know if you'd like help making a React component that displays the uploaded image after upload!

why sending back to backend again i mean backend is used twice

That’s a very good question, and you're catching an important detail! Let's break it down clearly:

❓ Why does it look like the backend is being "used twice"?
1. First time:
Frontend uploads the image to the backend via POST /upload-image.

This request sends the image file to the server.

The backend:
Receives it using multer.
Stores it (e.g., in uploads/ folder).
Then constructs and sends back the image URL to the frontend.

2. Second time:
Later, when the frontend displays the image (e.g., in an <img src="..." /> tag), the browser makes a GET request to that image URL (like http://localhost:5000/uploads/...).

This is handled by Express serving the static file using this line:

app.use('/uploads', express.static('uploads'));
🔁 So… is the backend actually "used twice"?
✅ Yes, technically, but for different purposes:

Step	Backend Role	Type of Request	Purpose
1️⃣	Save file & give URL	POST /upload-image	Handles the upload
2️⃣	Serve static file	GET /uploads/...	Lets browser view/download the image

But this is normal and expected. The backend:
First acts as the receiver of the file,
Then acts as a file server for future access to that file.
