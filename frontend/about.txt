16. About Auth layout--{children}
    *children is a special prop in React.
    *It refers to whatever JSX you wrap inside this component when you use it.
    ðŸ“¦ Example usage:
    *Suppose you use AuthLayout like this in your Login.js page:
    <AuthLayout>
    <p>Welcome back, please log in.</p>
    </AuthLayout>
    *Then children will be:<p>Welcome back, please log in.</p>
    *And it will be inserted at:{children}in your AuthLayout component.
    âœ… What does this mean?
    *Your layout gives a consistent outer structure (e.g., logo, styles, background), and children allows you to insert different content inside that layout.
    *This makes your layout reusable for both Login, SignUp, or any other page.

18.utils-helper:-
    *In a front-end app structure, the utils (short for utilities) folder is used to store reusable helper functions or modules that can be used throughout your application. These are not tied to a specific component or feature but provide general functionality.
    Common Uses of a utils Folder:
    Formatting Helpers e.g., formatDate.js, capitalize.js, formatCurrency.js
    Validation Functions e.g., validateEmail.js, isStrongPassword.js
    API Helpers e.g., fetchWithTimeout.js, handleApiErrors.js
    Conversion Utilities e.g., bytesToMB.js, secondsToTime.js
    Math or String Utilities e.g., roundToDecimal.js, truncateText.js
